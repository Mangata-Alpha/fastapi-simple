This project is something...
Born from deep curiosity, big imagination, and stubbornness. 
Unfortunately the lack of skill cannot back it up. So I learn stubbornly.
Read docs with weird wording and asking AI back and forth to explain me what is this nonsense. Ended up making my own analogies to understand. With minimal understanding of python, lack of javascript knowledge, only know the big picture of process.
